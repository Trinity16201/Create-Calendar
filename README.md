# Create-Calendar
This challenge helped to utilize some new items recently learned in class. Jquery, DayJS, and bootstrap were used to to complete this. I've enjoyed the styling of bootstrap over time as I've used it more. 

I can appreciate the usefulness of this application and the streamlined appearance. I learned more about local storage and continue to work on this understanding. I did reach out for help and discovered that I was on the right track, just missed a few key items. I reached out to a friend in the industry, read lots of different articles, and worked with fellow classmates.
